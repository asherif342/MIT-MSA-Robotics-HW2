# MIT-MSA-Robotics-HW2

Welcome to assignment 2! This will be done in 2 parts:

Part 1
Similar to what we showed during the lecture, the first step to creating an interaction between nodes is visualizing it through a node diagram (ROS graph). 
Read the comments and code in simple_node.py as well as safezone_broadcaster to figure out what the script is trying to achieve, then draw the diagram. This can be done on any medium,
such as pencil & paper, PowerPoint shapes, etc. Once you have a diagram, submit it on the slack channel #robotics-assignment-2. We will then verify if it's correct,
to which you will redraw it based on our comments or move on to part 2.


Part 2:
With a correct ROS architecture graph, you are now ready to start coding. Go back to the simple_node.py file and fill in the blanks. It should be straightforward once you have the correct relationships.
Once complete, submit the file to the same Slack channel.

Feel free to reach out on Slack either in the questions channel or in private if you have any questions.
